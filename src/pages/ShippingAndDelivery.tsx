          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            NexusVaults facilitates group purchases by coordinating between buyers and sellers. Once a group 
            purchase goal is met, the seller is notified to process and ship the orders. This policy outlines 
            the shipping and delivery process for purchases made through our platform.

            After a group purchase successfully reaches its target, sellers typically require 2-3 business days 
            to process and prepare orders for shipment. Processing time may vary depending on the product type 
            and seller. You will receive an email notification when your order is ready for dispatch.
